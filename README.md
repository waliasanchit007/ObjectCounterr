# ObjectCounterr
Android application to count number of objects

This is a camera app that continuously detects the objects in the frames seen by your device's back camera, and show the label and amount of object it detects.

We have leveraged the out-of-box API from TensorFlow Lite Task Library to integrate object detection models.

We have used [MobileNet SSD](https://tfhub.dev/tensorflow/lite-model/ssd_mobilenet_v1/1/metadata/2) model trained on the [COCO dataset](http://cocodataset.org/)
